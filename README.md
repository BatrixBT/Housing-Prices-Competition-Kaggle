# House Price Prediction using CatBoost, Kaggle Competition:

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features using the CatBoost Regressor. The model is trained on a dataset containing multiple housing attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various house-related attributes such as:

Square footage

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Location

Year built

Other relevant features...
